            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">The Story</h2>
            <p>Let's say we have two baseball teams in a division, we're about halfway through
                the season, and we want to see how likely each team is to win the division at the
                end of the season. This is good to know not only for fans, but for front offices
                as they decide whether it's worth it to be a buyer at the trade deadline (i.e. try
                to make trades to make their team better for this year at the cost of future years), or
                whether they're so unlikely to make the playoffs that it would be better to be a seller and
                trade players that are good now for prospects that will hopefully be good in the future.</p>
            <br>
            <p>&hookrightarrow; Click <span class="bg-green-500 text-white">Simulate Division</span> below to calculate
            the probabilities.</p>
            <division-element readonly="true">
                <team-games-back team-name="Astros" games-back="0"></team-games-back>
                <team-games-back highlight team-name="Blue Jays" games-back="2"></team-games-back>
            </division-element>
            <p>Great! So, being 2 games back, the Blue Jays have around a 38% chance of winning the division.
            </p>
            <p>But, now let's add a few more teams to the division.</p>
            <p>&hookrightarrow; Click <span class="bg-green-500 text-white">Simulate Division</span> below to calculate
            the probabilities.</p>
            <division-element readonly="true">
                <team-games-back team-name="Astros" games-back="0"></team-games-back>
                <team-games-back highlight team-name="Blue Jays" games-back="2"></team-games-back>
                <team-games-back team-name="Cubs" games-back="3"></team-games-back>
                <team-games-back team-name="Dodgers" games-back="3"></team-games-back>
                <team-games-back team-name="Eagles" games-back="4"></team-games-back>
            </division-element>
            <p>Even though the Blue Jays are still the same number of games back, and
                the new teams are further behind, this still reduces them to around a 21% chance
                to win the division!
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>This comes up a lot with wild card races, where the top 3 teams that aren't
                division leaders also qualify for the playoffs. Sometimes fans will think "hey, my
                team is only two games back of a wild card spot, that's hardly anything!", like the Pirates
                in this example:
            </p>
            <p>&hookrightarrow; Click <span class="bg-green-500 text-white">Simulate Division</span> below to calculate
            the probabilities.</p>
            <division-element readonly="true" winningTeams="3">
                <team-games-back team-name="Braves" games-back="0"></team-games-back>
                <team-games-back team-name="Padres" games-back="3"></team-games-back>
                <team-games-back team-name="Cardinals" games-back="4"></team-games-back>
                <team-games-back highlight team-name="Pirates" games-back="6"></team-games-back>
            </division-element>
            <p>And an over 50% chance is indeed pretty good! But let's look at the full standings (this is
            roughly based on the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/standings/wild-card/league?date=2024-07-01">NL wild card standings as of July 1, 2024</a>):

            <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Details</h2>
            <p>First of all, if you actually want to see playoffs odds for baseball,
            you should just look at <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com/standings/playoff-odds">FanGraphs</a> or
        <a href="https://www.baseballprospectus.com/standings/">Baseball Reference</a>.</p>
            <p>The calculations here assume there are exactly 80 games left in the season for all
                teams (which is why no half-game increments are allowed), every team has a 50% chance of
                winning each game, and it simulates
                this 5000 times. It also doesn't assume any of the teams are playing each other, although
                I don't think that would make a difference in the percentages.
            </p>
            <p>These calculation also handle ties in the least sophisticated way possible by giving "partial credit",
                so if two teams finish with the highest total wins they each get credit for half of a
                scenario for winning the division. If more than one team advances it's handled in a similar
                way.
